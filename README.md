# Humanity First Initiative

**Humanity First Initiative** is a college project built during the 5th semester of my Bachelor's degree. It was a web platform aimed at helping NGOs manage donations, events, and volunteers. While designed as a team project, the majority of the development (frontend, backend, and database integration) was handled individually by me.

## 📌 Project Overview

The platform allowed NGO admins to:

* Register and log in with two-factor email verification
* Post upcoming events and donation drives
* Track basic donation activity (mock, no real payment gateway)
* Manage newsletters and user communications

Regular users could:

* Sign up and verify via email
* View events, causes, and donation listings
* Subscribe to newsletters

## 🛠 Development Notes

* No third-party APIs or frameworks were used — everything was built from scratch with core Java and JSP.
* A newer Java 21 version was briefly worked on, but not maintained.
* The project was not deployed; it was developed and submitted for local evaluation by the college.
* It served as my first full-scale solo backend project and helped me understand session handling, database integration, and JSP-based templating.
* Mobile responsive

## 🚫 Limitations

* No real donation/payment gateway — all donation interactions were simulated.
* No deployment pipeline or CI/CD setup
* Mostly single-developer effort despite being a group project
